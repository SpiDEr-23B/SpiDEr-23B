    "\n",
    "- **Setup**: There are three doors—behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two doors are goats.\n",
    "- **Player's Initial Choice**: The player picks one of the three doors.\n",
    "- **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.\n",
    "- **Player's Decision**: The player is given the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.\n",
    "- **Optimal Strategy**: Switching doors gives the player a 2/3 chance of winning, while sticking with the initial choice gives a 1/3 chance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Code Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "   all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)  # Doors are numbered 1, 2, 3\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Randomly Assign the Prize**: `secret_winning_door` is randomly selected.\n",
    "   - **Prepare Door List**: Convert the tuple of doors to a list for manipulation.\n",

    "3. **Removing the Winning Door**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Removing the Player's Initial Choice**: If the player's choice isn't the winning door, remove it from the list.\n",
    "   - **Exception Handling**: If the player's choice is the winning door (already removed), the `remove` operation raises a `ValueError`, which is caught and ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Host Reveals a Goat Door**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Winning Probability When Always Switching**: Approximately 66.7% (or 2/3).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code correctly implements the Monty Hall simulation with the switching strategy. Running the simulation with a large number of repetitions (e.g., 100,000) should yield a winning probability close to 0.6667.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Suggestions for Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Using `try-except` Blocks for Control Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instead of using a `try-except` block to remove the player's initial choice, you can check if the element exists in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if my_door_choice in all_door_options_list:\n",
    "       all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Randomize the Player's Initial Choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "   To generalize the simulation, consider allowing the player's initial choice to be random:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_door_choice = np.random.choice(all_door_options)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reset `my_door_choice` Inside the Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you randomize the player's initial choice or need to reset it each iteration, make sure to define it inside the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(reps):\n",
    "       my_door_choice = np.random.choice(all_door_options)\n",
    "       # Rest of your code...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Efficiency**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **List Operations**: Minimize list manipulations to improve efficiency, especially for large numbers of repetitions.\n",
    "   - **Variable Naming**: Use descriptive variable names for better readability (e.g., `player_initial_choice`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your simulation accurately reflects the Monty Hall problem's dynamics when always switching doors. The result `i_won / reps` should converge to approximately 2/3 as the number of repetitions increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"

    "        next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `word_used` is a dictionary (`dict`) that will store the count of how many times each word appears in the corpus.\n",
    "   - `next_word` is a dictionary of dictionaries. For each word, it stores a dictionary of words that follow it and how many times each subsequent word occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Note:* The comments mention `defaultdict` from the `collections` module as an alternative. `defaultdict` simplifies handling missing keys by providing a default value, but in this code, regular dictionaries are used with explicit checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Through the Words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i, word in enumerate(words[:-1]):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The loop iterates over each word in the `words` list except the last one (`words[:-1]`), using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the `word`.\n",
    "   - We exclude the last word because we'll be accessing `words[i+1]` when looking at the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting Word Occurrences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if word in word_used:\n",
    "       word_used[word] += 1\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       word_used[word] = 1\n",
    "       next_word[word] = {}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **If the current word is already in `word_used`:**\n",
    "     - Increment its count by 1.\n",
    "   - **If the current word is not in `word_used`:**\n",
    "     - Initialize its count to 1.\n",
    "     - Initialize an empty dictionary for `next_word[word]` to store subsequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Counting Subsequent Word Occurrences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if words[i+1] in next_word[word]:\n",
    "       next_word[word][words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **If the next word (`words[i+1]`) is already in the `next_word` dictionary for the current word:**\n",
    "     - Increment the count of this subsequent word by 1.\n",
    "   - **If the next word is not in `next_word[word]`:**\n",
    "     - Initialize its count to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the Code Achieves:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`word_used` Dictionary:**\n",
    "  - Keeps track of how many times each word appears in the corpus.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    word_used = {\n",
    "        'hello': 3,\n",
    "        'world': 2,\n",
    "        'chatbot': 1,\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`next_word` Dictionary:**\n",
    "  - For each word, it maps to a dictionary of words that can follow it, along with the counts of how often each subsequent word occurs.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    next_word = {\n",
    "        'hello': {'world': 2, 'there': 1},\n",
    "        'world': {'!': 2},\n",
    "        'chatbot': {'is': 1},\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How This Relates to a Markovian Chatbot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markov Chains in Text Generation:**\n",
    "  - A Markov chain models the probability of transitioning from one state to another. In text generation, states are words or sequences of words.\n",
    "  - The next word in a sequence is chosen based on the probability distribution of possible subsequent words, derived from the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using the Data Structures:**\n",
    "  - **Generating Next Words:**\n",
    "    - For a given current word, `next_word` provides the possible next words and their frequencies.\n",
    "    - Probabilities can be calculated by dividing the count of each subsequent word by the total count of all subsequent words for the current word.\n",
    "  - **Generating Text:**\n",
    "    - Starting from an initial word, the chatbot can randomly select the next word based on the calculated probabilities.\n",
    "    - This process is repeated to generate a sequence of words that forms a sentence or paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Text Generation Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting Word:**\n",
    "   - Suppose we start with the word `'hello'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Possible Next Words:**\n",
    "   - From `next_word['hello']`, we have:\n",
    "     - `'world'`: count 2\n",
    "     - `'there'`: count 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating Probabilities:**\n",
    "   - Total counts: `2 + 1 = 3`\n",
    "   - Probability of `'world'`: `2 / 3 ≈ 66.7%`\n",
    "   - Probability of `'there'`: `1 / 3 ≈ 33.3%`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Selecting the Next Word:**\n",
    "   - Use these probabilities to randomly select the next word.\n",
    "   - If `'world'` is selected, we repeat the process using `next_word['world']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of This Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Captures Local Structure:**\n",
    "  - By considering the frequencies of word transitions, the chatbot can generate text that respects the local ordering of words in the training corpus.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:**\n",
    "  - First-order Markov models (considering only one previous word) are straightforward to implement and require less computational resources.\n",
    "- **Adaptability:**\n",
    "  - The model can be extended to higher-order Markov chains by considering sequences of words (n-grams) instead of single words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Sparsity:**\n",
    "  - With limited data, some word transitions may not be well represented, leading to less varied or repetitive outputs.\n",
    "- **Lack of Global Context:**\n",
    "  - First-order Markov models do not consider the broader context or semantics beyond immediate word transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using `defaultdict`:**\n",
    "  - The commented import suggests using `defaultdict` to simplify the code:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "    word_used = defaultdict(int)\n",
    "    next_word = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - With `defaultdict`, you don't need to check if a key exists before updating its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher-Order Models:**\n",
    "  - To improve the model, you can use bi-grams or tri-grams (sequences of 2 or 3 words) as the states in the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code builds frequency-based models (`word_used` and `next_word`) that capture how words are used and how they transition from one to another in the training corpus.\n",
    "- These models form the basis of a Markovian chatbot, allowing it to generate text that statistically resembles the input data.\n",
    "- Understanding and implementing these data structures are crucial steps in creating a basic text-generating chatbot using Markov chains.\n"

    "The provided code snippet is part of a process to build a Markov chain model for a chatbot that mimics the speech patterns of characters from the \"Avatar\" dataset. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Modules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`Counter`**: Used to count occurrences of elements in an iterable.\n",
    "   - **`defaultdict`**: Provides a default value for missing keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Character Names:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   characters = Counter(\"\\n\"+ avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ','.')+\":\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`avatar.character`**: Accesses the 'character' column from the 'avatar' dataset.\n",
    "   - **`str.upper()`**: Converts all character names to uppercase.\n",
    "   - **`str.replace(' ','.')`**: Replaces spaces in character names with dots (`.`).\n",
    "     - Example: `'Toph Beifong'` becomes `'TOPH.BEIFONG'`.\n",
    "   - **Concatenation**:\n",
    "     - Adds a colon (`:`) at the end of each name.\n",
    "     - Prepends a newline character (`\\n`) to the entire string.\n",
    "   - **`Counter(...)`**: Counts the frequency of each character (letter) in the resulting string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Purpose**: Although `Counter` is used here, the main goal is to create a collection (`characters`) that contains all the modified character names. The use of `Counter` allows us to check for the presence of character names efficiently using the `in` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining a Recursive Nested Dictionary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\n",
    "   word_used2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   next_word2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`nested_dict`**: A recursive lambda function that creates a `defaultdict` of itself, allowing for infinitely nested dictionaries.\n",
    "   - **`word_used2C`**: Will store counts of bigrams (pairs of words) for each character.\n",
    "   - **`next_word2C`**: Will store counts of possible next words (trigrams) following each bigram for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building the Markov Chain Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "       if word in characters:\n",
    "           character = word\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`words`**: A list of words from the dialogue text, likely preprocessed to match the formatting of character names (uppercase with dots and colons).\n",
    "   - **`enumerate(words[:-2])`**: Iterates over the words, excluding the last two to prevent index errors when accessing `words[i+1]` and `words[i+2]`.\n",
    "   - **Identifying Speaker Changes**:\n",
    "     - When the current `word` matches a character name in `characters`, it indicates a change in the speaker.\n",
    "     - The `character` variable is updated to keep track of the current speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Counting Bigrams and Trigrams:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Updating Bigrams:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "       if character not in word_used2C:\n",
    "           word_used2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "       if word+' '+words[i+1] not in word_used2C[character]:\n",
    "           word_used2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] = 0\n",
    "       word_used2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`word_used2C[character]`**: A dictionary that counts how many times each bigram occurs for the current character.\n",
    "   - **`word+' '+words[i+1]`**: Forms a bigram by combining the current word and the next word.\n",
    "   - **Counting**:\n",
    "     - Initializes the count for the bigram if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "     - Increments the count for each occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Updating Trigrams:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "       if character not in next_word2C:\n",
    "           next_word2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "       if word+' '+words[i+1] not in next_word2C[character]:\n",
    "           next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]] = dict()\n",
    "       if words[i+2] not in next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]]:\n",
    "           next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]][words[i+2]] = 0\n",
    "       next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]][words[i+2]] += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`next_word2C[character][word+' '+words[i+1]]`**: A nested dictionary that, for each bigram, counts how many times each possible next word occurs.\n",
    "   - **`words[i+2]`**: The word following the bigram, forming a trigram.\n",
    "   - **Counting**:\n",
    "     - Initializes the count for the trigram if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "     - Increments the count for each occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Purpose of the Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Building Character-Specific Language Models**:\n",
    "     - The code collects statistics on word usage for each character.\n",
    "     - By counting bigrams and trigrams, it captures the likelihood of word sequences specific to each character's speech patterns.\n",
    "   - **Preparing for Text Generation**:\n",
    "     - These counts can be used to create probability distributions.\n",
    "     - A Markov chain model can then generate new dialogue that mimics how each character speaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Handling Speaker Context:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The use of `if word in characters` allows the model to switch context when a character's name appears in the text, indicating a new speaker.\n",
    "   - This ensures that the language model for each character is built only from their own lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code processes dialogue text from the \"Avatar\" dataset to build character-specific Markov chain models. It identifies when speakers change, counts how often each pair of words (bigrams) and triplets of words (trigrams) occur in their speech, and organizes this information into nested dictionaries. These models can then be used to generate new, character-authentic dialogue for a chatbot."

    "AI-driven assistance tools, such as ChatGPT, is a very useful tool that help people deeply understand about coding, statistics, and data science. From my conversation with ChatGPT in STA130, learning coding with those tools are very helpful. I can provide my code of question, and it will give a very specific answer to the code, from the general use to each line of code. I believe it is a great tool for statistics and data science too. I have used the tool for explaining Monte Hall and Markovian chain topics, and it is good at giving a simple explanation that is easy to understand. However, I think other resources like videos and textbooks are helpful in understanding Statistics and Data science topics too.\n",

    "You provided a code snippet related to building a Markov chain model for a chatbot using the \"Avatar\" dataset. The code processes character names and dialogue to create character-specific language models. Specifically, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Processes Character Names:**\n",
    "   - Converts character names to uppercase and replaces spaces with dots.\n",
    "   - Uses `Counter` to create a collection of modified character names for efficient lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defines Nested Dictionaries:**\n",
    "   - Uses a recursive `defaultdict` to create infinitely nested dictionaries for storing word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Builds the Markov Chain Model:**\n",
    "   - Iterates through a list of words from the dialogue text.\n",
    "   - Identifies speaker changes by checking if a word matches a character name.\n",
    "   - Counts bigrams (pairs of words) and trigrams (triplets of words) for each character.\n",
    "   - Organizes these counts into nested dictionaries (`word_used2C` and `next_word2C`).\n",
    "\n",
    "I provided a detailed explanation of each part of the code, including its purpose and how it contributes to building the Markov chain model. This model can generate new dialogue that mimics each character's speech patterns. You requested this summary for the purpose of submitting ChatBot assistance for your homework assignments."
